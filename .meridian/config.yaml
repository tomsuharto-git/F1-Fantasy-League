# Project-level configuration for the Claude workflow

# Project type affects which code guide add-on is loaded:
# - hackathon   → use CODE_GUIDE_ADDON_HACKATHON.md
# - standard    → baseline only (Grid Kings: balanced for feature building)
# - production  → use CODE_GUIDE_ADDON_PRODUCTION.md
project_type: standard

# Optional: Test-Driven Development mode.
# When true, inject CODE_GUIDE_ADDON_TDD.md and follow its rules.
# Grid Kings: TDD enabled for better code quality during feature building
tdd_mode: true
